# Fingerprint-Attendance-System-Using-Arduino
 The most common use of this system is to manage students attendance in school &amp; collages. Traditionally faculties take attendance manually and manages records on paper. This process is very time consuming, non- user friendly and tedious .To resolve mentioned issues, we are developing  a fingerprint attendance system to help faculty members, in this project, many of the processes are automated which perform activities  like progress report of the student. This will result in more free time for faculty which can be spend improving student skill development &amp; co-curricular activities. Fingerprint identification is one of the most well known and common biometric identification system Because of their uniqueness &amp; consistency over time. The record of the fingerprints of various students  and  other information will be maintained in a database. The communication between the pc and module was done by ARDUINO REV3 (clone) circuit.

ABOUT SOFTWARE
SOFTWARE TOOLS USED: 
	Microsoft visual basic .net(2013) for GUI
	Xampp server (MYSQL) for database 


WHY MYSQL: 

	It's easy to use: MYSQL is very easy to use. With only a few simple sql statements, you can build and interact with MYSQL.
	It's secure: MYSQL includes solid data security layers that protect sensitive data from intruders. Passwords are encrypted.
	It's scalable: MYSQL can handle almost any amount of data, up to as much as 50 million rows or more. The default file size limit is about 4 GB. 
	It runs on many operating systems: MYSQL runs on many operating systems, including windows, linux, many varieties of unix, and others.

WHY .NET

	OOP language :it is object oriented programming language. It support 18+ languages such as c/c#/j#/java/vb etc.

	It’s easy to use :it makes form easier with use of different controls simply drag and drop.

	CLR(common language runtime):features 
a)	Deployment makes easier
b)	Common language supported
c)	Security mechanism secured
d)	Software isolation

	It runs on many operating systems:.net runs on many operating systems, including windows, linux, many varieties of unix, and others.
