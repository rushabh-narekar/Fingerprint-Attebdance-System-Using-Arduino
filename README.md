# Fingerprint-Attebdance-System-Using-Arduino
 The most common use of this system is to manage students attendance in school &amp; collages. Traditionally faculties take attendance manually and manages records on paper. This process is very time consuming, non- user friendly and tedious .To resolve mentioned issues, we are developing  a fingerprint attendance system to help faculty members, in this project, many of the processes are automated which perform activities  like progress report of the student. This will result in more free time for faculty which can be spend improving student skill development &amp; co-curricular activities. Fingerprint identification is one of the most well known and common biometric identification system Because of their uniqueness &amp; consistency over time. The record of the fingerprints of various students  and  other information will be maintained in a database. The communication between the pc and module was done by ARDUINO REV3 (clone) circuit.
